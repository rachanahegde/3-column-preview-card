## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Media Queries 

### What I learned

This project mainly involved reviewing basic HTML/CSS concepts I had learned from online courses. However, I also learned how to use CSS flexbox to build a more responsive website and became more comfortable with using media queries. 

### Continued development

In the future, I want to learn to write in SASS and use a mobile-first design approach.

### Useful resources

- [A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This helped me successfully implement CSS flexbox.
- [Learn to Code HTML & CSS](https://learn.shayhowe.com/) - This textbook has taught me a lot about responsive web design and HTML & CSS concepts that I applied in this project.
